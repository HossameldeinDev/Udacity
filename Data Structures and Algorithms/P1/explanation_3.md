## Efficiency

Huffman coding excels in optimizing data storage, showcasing significant space efficiency:

- **Space Efficiency:** Achieved by utilizing variable-length bit codes, Huffman coding compresses data size notably, ideal for frequent character occurrences. Despite this, maintaining the Huffman tree and encoding dictionary requires space proportional to unique characters, marked as O(n).

- **Time Efficiency:** The construction of the Huffman tree, essential for encoding/decoding, benefits from a binary heap priority queue, promoting an optimal O(nlogn) time complexity during this critical phase.

## Code Design

Strategic choices in Huffman coding ensure streamlined operations and resource management:

- **Priority Queue Implementation:** Opting for a binary heap for the priority queue efficiently handles continuous low-frequency node extractions, vital for Huffman tree construction, thereby enhancing the algorithm's responsiveness.

- **Balanced Space Management:** While the Huffman tree occupies memory based on the input's diversity, the trade-off for considerably reduced data size underscores its practicality in various applications, marking a balanced space economy.
