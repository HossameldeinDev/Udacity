Opting for Huffman coding in data compression directly addresses the need for space efficiency, as it reduces the overall size of the stored data by using variable-length bit codes for different characters based on their frequencies. The choice of a priority queue in the form of a binary heap was strategic, facilitating efficient construction of the Huffman tree by continuously extracting the two lowest-frequency nodes during the combination process. This data structure is particularly adept at handling such operations, leading to an optimal time complexity of O(nlogn) for building the tree, which is the most resource-intensive aspect of the algorithm.

In terms of space efficiency, the Huffman approach shines by creating compressed data that often significantly requires less space than the original input, especially if certain characters recur frequently. However, itâ€™s worth noting that the space required to maintain the Huffman tree (which is the core structure used for encoding and decoding) and the dictionary for quick lookup of character encodings is O(n), directly proportional to the number of unique characters in the input data. This balance between the space required for the tree structure and the savings gained from the compressed data is a key factor in the utility of Huffman coding in various applications.
