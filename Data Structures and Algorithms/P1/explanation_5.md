## Efficiency

### Time Efficiency
- Adding blocks operates in `O(1)` time, ensuring quick execution.
- The validation function, running in `O(n)`, balances thoroughness with performance due to its linear traversal.

### Space Efficiency
- The space complexity is `O(n)`, directly related to the number of blocks in the chain. Each block's consistent structure keeps memory use predictable and manageable.

## Code Design

### Integrity through Hashing
- By incorporating each block's timestamp, data, and the previous block's hash into its hash calculation, the design safeguards against alterations and ensures the integrity of the entire chain.

### Simplicity in Structure
- The use of fundamental data structures (like lists for the chain and classes for the blocks) enhances code readability and maintainability, which is crucial for systems where transparency is vital.

### Consistency via Validation
- Employing a `validate_chain` method, the blockchain maintains its overall integrity by systematically checking the validity of each block and its connection to preceding entries.
