## Efficiency

Recursion in our file search utility provides effective navigation through complex directory structures:

- **Time Efficiency:** With a time complexity of O(n), the recursive method ensures a thorough examination of each directory and file, correlating directly with the total number of elements in the filesystem.

- **Space Efficiency:** The space complexity stands at O(n), representing the stack space usage for each recursive call. This mirrors the current exploration depth, providing a balanced approach between thorough search and resource management.

## Code Design

The choice of recursion is anchored in its proficiency in handling complex navigations:

- **Simplicity and Abstraction:** By naturally managing intricate file traversing processes, recursion enhances code readability and maintainability, streamlining the logic necessary for exploring deep, nested directories.

- **Efficient Directory Exploration:** The recursive approach excels in situations with unpredictable directory hierarchies, offering a comprehensive and efficient strategy for deep file searches without sacrificing performance.
